## About MI-CLAIM
MI-CLAIM has two purposes: first, to enable a direct assessment of clinical impact, including fairness and bias; and second, to allow rapid replication of the technical design process of any legitimate clinical AI study.

### About This Repo
Our goal is to develop a documentation standard that can serve clinical scientists, data scientists, and the clinicians of the future who will be using these tools. To that end, a checklist is provided as a part of MI-CLAIM that should be included along with each clinical AI model or manuscript. Additionally, we hope that this description will stimulate discussion of the proposed MI-CLAIM standards, and we encourage the clinical community, as well as the AI community, to provide us with their views on how this standard can be improved. This repository has been set up to coincide with the release of the paper and will allow the community to comment on existing sections and suggest additions. Please contribute by generating Issues.

As we gather feedback, and as the field evolves, we plan to publish comprehensive updates to the MI-CLAIM standards
